            <h5>My role:</h5>
            <p>
                This project took place during my final semester at University from July 2019 – October 2019. It was a
                final project as a student to showcase my skills that I had accumulated over the years throughout the
                Interaction Design course at the University of Technology Sydney as well as learning myself along the
                way. I was part of a small team of three, where I was responsible for leading the collaboration as well
                as the research, design and implementing the features and overall user experience related to a native
                iOS application for the purpose of facilitating a learning experience for users into the Keto-genic
                diet.

            <h5>The Problem</h5>
            <p></p>

            <h5>The Approach</h5>
            <p></p>

            <h5>Usability Testing / User Studies</h5>
            <p></p>

            <h5>Overview of Final Functional Prototype</h5>
            <p>The Plantamagotchi is a physically interactive project that aimed to provide users a learning experience
                while tying in
                physical elements that enhanced their interactions, providing more value and instant entertainment to a
                slow
                and gradual
                process. Ideation and formulation of prototype and design was done through a variety of sessions that
                ultimately
                amounted to become the Plantamagotchi in its final form. The plantamagotchi provided varying levels of
                feedback to
                users, with the purpose of “game”-ifying the experience of having a potted plant where the premise was
                to
                cater to the
                needs and requirements of the plant (soil moisture, temperature, pH level and ambient humidity) of the
                given
                parameters
                in plant and its digital counterpart to stay alive.</p><br><br>
